    Introduction
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
    In this report, our group (Taylor, Emmet, Saajid and Sam) will discuss
    various aspects of the IT Industry, ranging from different kinds of IT
    jobs/roles to the different kinds of IT Technologies that are available to
    the world today and what we’re able to accomplish with these.

    Team Profile
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
    To begin with, our group needed to decide on a name that we could use to
    refer to the group as a whole. We did have a couple options but in the end
    we decided to go with TESS, which simply comes from the first initial of
    each of our preferred names. Admittedly, it’s not the most creative name
    out there, but it works.

                        I grew up in a small regional Victorian Town called
                        Camperdown where I attended school at Mercy Regional
                        College. This is where I met a lot of my friends, who I
                        still talk to and hang out with on a regular basis.
                        I’ve got a little over 2 years of experience working in
                        IT support and am currently doing a full-time IT
                        Project Management Traineeship which will get me a Cert
                        IV in Business.

                        As for as hobbies go, the main ones to include would be
                        weightlifting, guitar, and a little bit of gaming. I’ve
                        also been dabbling in a bit of 3D modelling lately
                        using blender which has been really fun.

                        Born in 1990, I am a dual national with a culturally
                        diverse and artistic background, raised in both Ireland
                        and New Zealand.

                        different locations and cities from Cork Ireland to
                        Sydney Australia. I finished my high school education
                        in West Cork, Ireland in 2008 where I embarked on a
                        creative path exploring audio production through
                        initially S.I.T Invercargill, New Zealand and then SAE
                        London, England. My interest in information technology
                        stems from two elements, firstly my comfort level with
                        using technology and secondly my discomfort with a lack
                        of deep understanding and implementation of this
                        technology.

                        football (soccer) and rowing.

                        Living in Melbourne since 2016. I had a Diploma in IT
                        (Networking) in 2018 from Holmesglen TAFE. Then, worked
                        as Network Administrator at an MSP company. Recently, I
                        joined a new company as a System Engineer currently
                        studying at RMIT, planning to complete my Bachelor in
                        IT. I have a good understanding of Networking, but I
                        want to enrich my knowledge by studying at RMIT. Some
                        of my hobbies are beatboxing, cycling and reading about
                        planetary science.

<p dir="ltr">
    In an attempt for each member of TESS to get a better understanding or one
    another, our group underwent some personality tests online. While these
    tests don’t provide a 100% accurate description of each individual member,
    they do provide some insight as to where each person comes from when they
    are expressing their opinions. Below is a table which includes the general

    Once each of our team members had gone through and completed their
    personality tests, our team discussed what this meant for the team and
    which roles each individual would play.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Although personality tests aren’t a concrete measurement of an individual’s
    way of interacting with others. The results can provide some insights as to
    how our group dynamic could operate. The results above indicate that each
    one of us would be able to step into the leadership role if the need
    presented itself. However, you can also see that there are members of our
    group that are much more suited to being supportive of others' ideas and
    helping other members of the group get their thoughts across in a more
    clear and concise manner. Over the weeks spent working on this project it
    became pretty evident that the members of our group got along nicely and
    had a mutual respect for one another. Each member of our group was asked to
    reflect on the above personality results individually and here is what we
    had to say:
</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    Taylor
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I will need to be careful and considerate when sharing my opinions with the
    other members of the group. The ‘16 Personalities’ test gave me some
    insight as to what my personality types' biggest strengths and weaknesses
    are, from the extensive list I chose the two that I felt were most
    applicable to myself, those being ‘perceptive’ and ‘insensitive’
    respectively.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To work effectively in a group setting, it is important that I keep the
    other group members’ emotions in mind. On the other hand, me being
    perceptive could come in very handy for our group. If a situation were to
    arise where we were not sure if we had completed all the requirements of
    the assignment, it is possible that I would be able to notice that
    something is missing.
</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    Emmet
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    Identifying my personality type and learning style, helped me to gauge
    where I should and should not be placing my energy to better succeed in
    Tess our assessment two group. The Myer-Briggs ‘16Personalities’ test
    results helped me distinguish my biggest strengths of being self-confident,
    strong-willed, energetic, efficient, strategic thinker as well as my
    weaknesses being intolerant, impatient, stubborn and dominant. My colour
    result was purple “reformer type’ which identified that I would have
    difficulty working with green ‘helper types’ luckily no one in our group
    had this personality type. My learning style results Reflector/Pragmatist
    showed that I would need to observe and reflect to be able to put the
    learning obtained into practice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I took it upon myself to observe and analyse my weaknesses to mitigate the
    damage I could impose on TESS
</p>
<br/>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    Saajid
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    The three personality tests were a great way for me to understand myself
    better and helped me figure out what I would need to change for me to work
    with my group, or any other group, productively. The '16 Personalities'
    showed me that my weaknesses mainly revolved around selflessness. While
    being selfless could be a good quality at times, at most, it could cause
    the downfall of my own work, if I pay too much attention to others.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    From that same test though, I was shown my main strengths, which were those
    of which a good group would need to have. Of them would be that I'm loyal,
    which means I can be relied on to complete my share of the assignment.
</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    Sam
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    The personality tests helped me to have self-confidence and self-awareness.
    I have never looked at my characteristics so deeply. I never tried to give
    myself credit for being empathic to others because I think this is how we
    should be. As per Myer-Briggs, it is my strength. I now know why people
    find me warm and friendly and how I get along so well with even the
    introverts. This has boosted my confidence and self-awareness.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But I disagree with some of the weaknesses that Myer-Briggs suggested. One
    of them is helping others and being over-empathic. I love to do this, and I
    find satisfaction in this way. I do not think it is my weakness. Instead, I
    think it is my strength. By helping others, we can make a better society.
    We should help each other as much as we can. So, I will never change this
    behaviour.

    As shown above, each member of our group is interested in programming in
    one way shape or form. Meaning that the experience we need to acquire to
    land these jobs will fall mostly within the same realm. As we are all
    working towards the same goals, it wouldn’t be a big surprise if the first
    step to each of our IT journeys would be something along the lines of a
    junior software engineer.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a junior software engineer, each member of our group would obtain the
    industry knowledge and experience necessary to start making bigger strides
    towards their greater goals. Once each member of our group has developed a
    baseline level of skill and experience in the junior role, we should be
    able to move into roles that are more geared towards our ideal jobs. Taylor
    and Saajid for example would like to be software engineers, their options
    after obtaining experience could be moving into a more involved role with a
    start-up company, making their own start-up, or getting their foot in the
    door at a bigger company by starting off with more basic programming.

    Above is data provided by Burning Glass regarding the current top skills
    that employers are looking for that are IT specific. The skills that our
    group would collectively need to acquire to land our ideal jobs are as
    follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Programming/Software development skills (Java and JS seem to be
            most popular)

<p dir="ltr">
    There are also opportunities for informal learning that our group may want
    to consider individually. To use Emmet and Sam as examples in this
    scenario, Emmet may want to branch off on his own and spend some of his
    free time developing his own website and exploring more common website
    technologies such as JavaScript. It would also be beneficial to read up on
    User-Experience and User-Interface.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Sam already tinkers with robots of his own and is gaining more and more
    understanding of robotics and raspberry pi’s. It could also be beneficial
    if Sam spent some time on his own studying the skills he deemed necessary
    above such as the engineering knowledge he pointed out, or even physics and
    math.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are many opportunities for informal learning and experience across
    the board. Taylor and Saajid could work on some indie projects of their
    own, whether it be developing a game or even playing around with current
    game engines such as Unity or Unreal to gain an understanding of how
    Software / Gameplay engineers work.

    In this section, our group interviewed Zakaria Mansfield from Pro IT, which
    is an Australian founded professional IT services and consulting company.
    Their client base includes both international and Australian financial
    institutions.

<p dir="ltr">
    Zak's role within this company is a Network Operations Centre Technician
    based in Melbourne, Victoria. Zak is responsible for monitoring daily
    activities needed to manage IT services and support IT infrastructure. For
    example, a typical day on the job for Zak will include maintenance of
    Acronis backups, rostering and scheduling work for the company’s field
    engineers, managing Office 365, and organising and overseeing twice daily
    meetings with members of his team. It’s also worth noting that Zak works a
    rotating roster. Meaning that some days he will start at 7am and other days
    he might start at 3pm and work 8 hours from there.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We asked Zak what the hardest part about landing a job like his was. His
    response was simply getting that first foot in the door, Zak stated that he
    “Applied for six months straight and barely got a call back” before finally
    landing his first job in the IT industry. Zak's first role in IT was
    actually a call centre role where he would take incoming calls and provide
    technical support where he could or escalate the issue if need be.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As well as his typical day-to-day duties, Zak will also undertake work in
    different areas within his company. To name a few, Zak will often get
    involved with computer hardware such as building desktop machines and
    servers. Setting up servers isn’t too out of the ordinary for a NOC
    Technician, but setting up desktop machines for end-users is something that
    you wouldn’t typically expect of someone in this role.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Zak will interact with a whole range of people while on the job. The
    majority of his communications being his colleagues and the people that he
    coordinates, of course. But Zak will also have conversations with people
    from other companies that have a contract with Pro IT, whether that be
    setting up new clients and bringing them on board, or assisting existing
    clients with their current issues. Surprisingly, Zak will also interact
    with regular people, which at Pro IT they call ‘free consults’, these are
    users that don’t have a contract with Pro IT but are still able to receive
    help from the IT professionals within the company.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Zak will have a significant amount of contact with other IT professionals
    throughout the course of a day. Part of Zak's role is managing field
    engineers and making sure they know what work needs to get done for the day
    and where they need to be. Zak is also responsible for organising twice
    daily team members with members of his team also working in the NOC.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A lot of Zak’s time is spent organising staff and field engineers and his
    other typical duties stated above. But there are other projects that will
    take up his time throughout the day. For example, a project that he is
    working on right now is rolling out a new ticketing system. This is
    essentially installing and setting up some software on a virtual machine,
    but there’s also a training aspect to rolling out new software and this is
    something that Zak is also going to be responsible for. Zak will need to
    train ProIT’s users on how to use this new ticketing system, which will be
    important as Zak already takes calls from free consults, adding end-users
    into that mix would be less than ideal.

    Zak’s optimism towards IT really gave the impression that there wasn’t a
    whole lot about his job that he found particularly challenging. He did
    mention however, that the difficulties he will face throughout the week are
    that of organising not only himself, but the staff members he is
    responsible for. He stated that the biggest challenge is keeping on top of
    everything and making sure everyone, including himself, has a plan for the
    day and knows what they’re supposed to be doing.

    Machine Learning
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    Machine Learning is Artificial Intelligence are two things that are spoken
    of as if they are separate from one another. The reality is that machine
    learning is a more complex branch of your typical artificial intelligence.
    That’s not to say that they aren’t vastly different in the way that these
    algorithms/programs are created. Simply put, artificial intelligence is a
    program that is written to carry out a simple task as a mimicry of human
    behaviour, a very basic example of this would be using a program to sort
    emails that contain the word ‘sale’ into a junk folder (or different
    subfolder) in your inbox. Machine learning however, is closer to being a
    mimicry of the human brain. Machine learning is a program or algorithm that
    will continually grow and ‘learn’ as time goes on using large datasets
    instead of hard coded rules. These databases continually grow as time goes
    by and as a result, end-users of certain platforms are feeding these
    algorithms more information that is being used to train the algorithm
    further. The benefit of these kinds of programs is that they are able to
    carry out tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you were wondering how machine learning is used today, take a look at
    your YouTube recommendations, or the “Up Next” feature that has recently
    been implemented in addition to the autoplay feature. This is how these
    technologies are used by big companies today to keep us on their websites.
    When creating the Up Next feature, YouTube realised that this had to be
    significantly more complex that the recommendation systems of applications
    such as Spotify. Because YouTube is constantly growing and thousands of
    videos are uploaded to the website every minute, they needed a system where
    the up next section would recommend a video based on multiple things.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The biggest features taken into consideration when recommending you a video
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            User watch history (topics) and
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            User’s with similar watch histories rankings of an up next
            ‘candidate’
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    This feature ties in well with how the recommended section of YouTube works
    as well. In a similar way, the recommended section of your YouTube page
    takes into account these same features.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But there’s more to it than just that. It’s no secret that YouTube still
    wants to make you spend as much time on their platform as they possibly
    can. To accomplish this, the recommendation algorithm will generate a
    shortlist of over one-hundred video candidates based on relevant features
    such as the video topic, watch time, and various other features of the
    video that the user is currently streaming. The algorithm will then sort
    those candidates using the user’s likes, clicks, watch times, and other
    information that it has been fed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Moving away from YouTubes recommendations and diving deeper into how
    machine learning algorithms are created. The Two biggest kinds of learning
    that can be utilized by machine learning systems are known as supervised,
    and unsupervised learning. Let’s break down exactly what those terms mean.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Firstly, Supervised Learning is when an algorithm is fed an input and an
    expected output, this is what is known as the training data. Once the
    machine has been fed enough training data it is then able to process inputs
    and come up with an estimated output. If the supervisor sees that the
    machine got its output wrong, then the machine will adjust it’s
    calculations until it no longer makes any mistakes. An example of
    unsupervised learning could be something like a weather prediction AI.

<p dir="ltr">
    Then we have Unsupervised Learning, which is machine learning using
    datasets without a specified structure. Essentially the machine is just
    left to try and make logical classification from data that it is given.
    Unsupervised learning is particularly useful when it comes to pattern
    recognition that humans typically do not pick up on. These algorithms are
    able to discover hidden patterns and analyze on their own. Making them
    ideal for customer segmentation, exploratory data analysis and more.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To take this a step deeper. The most popular method of machine learning
    used in the modern world is Deep Learning using Neural Networks. An example
    of unsupervised learning. This is the kind of machine learning (to what we
    have today) that most closely resembles a living brain. This is because a
    neural network uses the concept of neurons - which take an input, process
    that input and produce an output.

<p dir="ltr">
    The example used here is for airlines, but the concept is the same across
    many other topics. Over on the left side we have the input layer. This is
    where the algorithm will take inputs that are to be processed. The blue
    circles in the middle are what we call ‘hidden layers’. It’s inside these
    layers where the machine learning algorithm will process the inputs (or
    features) that were previously given to produce an output shown by the
    orange circle labelled ‘price’.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s worth noting that the amount of hidden layers in a neural network have
    a range of two or more. One of the bigger challenges of deep learning
    networks is deciding how many hidden layers the algorithm will need to be
    most efficient. Some algorithms obviously need more than others, it depends
    on the amount of features/columns/examples/etc. It’s within these layers
    that the information is processed and the machine performs mathematical
    computations on the inputs provided.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Each connection between the neurons is associated with a weight, which is
    generally chosen at random to begin with. You can think of the weight as a
    way of determining the importance of an input value. There are more numbers
    that go into this deep learning method such as a bias (typically (-1, 1) or
    {0, 1)). The important thing to remember here is that these computations
    will use these weights to determine what’s most important and to
    standardise the outputs given by previous neurons. These computations will
    occur over and over, becoming more and more accurate with each iteration.

    What machine learning means for the future is good things. For example,
    today machine learning can be used to give a diagnosis for a range of
    medical issues including breast cancer. While not 100% accurate, the
    decision boundaries in some algorithms are very close to being able to give
    proper diagnosis. Given that there are so many rows of medical information
    located inside databases, it’s no big surprise that machine learning
    algorithms can process symptoms and doctors diagnosis’ to accurately give
    machine diagnosis to patients.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Another big thing that machine learning is already being used for in
    today’s world is self-driving cars. As will likely be explained in the
    Autonomous Vehicles section, machine learning used in these vehicles can
    take information from a number of cameras and sensors attached to the
    vehicle and use this information to get a passenger from point A to point
    B.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Of course this doesn’t come without downfalls. There are many ethical
    issues surrounding the decision a self-driving vehicle would have to make
    if it were given an ultimatum - running down a group of pedestrians, or
    crashing and killing the driver. While this is a rare situation it’s still
    something that has to be considered and no one can really think of a good
    answer.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Finally, what machine learning could mean for myself, and the people around
    me is that the world of Information Technology is going to continue
    growing, and the pace at which the world is going to develop is uncertain.
    With each new machine learning technology that is released, parts of our
    everyday lives are going to continually grow easier. Machine learning could
    help humans out in a big way, especially when it comes to saving time doing
    monotonous tasks. I do not personally believe that robots will replace
    every single hauman job in the future, but it’s definitely possible that
    machines could replace jobs which require a lot of repetition, calculation
    and hypothesizing.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Machine learning is still a developing field and it’s exciting to think of
    what artificial intelligence will be capable of even 5 years from now.

    Cloud, Services, Servers
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    Cloud computing can be defined as the delivery of computing services over
    the internet. The cloud is essentially a data warehouse full of servers
    used for the purpose of hosting data storage, web applications and more.
    You can think of data warehouses as large buildings with a lot of air
    conditioning to support the housing of multiple computer and server racks.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is
    responsible for developing standards and guidelines on cloud computing,
    defines it as a “model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.
    networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
    provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider
    interaction.” This cloud model is composed of five essential
    characteristics, three models and four deployment models (Peter Mell &amp;
    Timothy Grance, NIST, Page 2)

    There are five essential characteristics of cloud computing today and those
    are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            On Demand Self Service - The ability to perform computing processes
            without requiring interaction with each service provider.

    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Location Transparent Resource Pooling - The clouds computing
            resources are pooled together to allow for greater efficiency. In
            other words, clients that use minimal computing power will require
            less system resources than clients who use large amounts of
            resources.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>

        <p dir="ltr">
            Rapid Elasticity - The cloud can be easily scaled as the number of
            connected clients increase. Clouds typically expand, which is why
            it is so important for the system to allow for expansion and
            scalability

            Measured Service - The ability to measure the clouds performance in
            some way, shape or form. (Bandwidth, processing, etc.)

    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
    Cloud computing deployment models can be used to identify how servers are
    utilized and provisioned over the internet. Currently, there are four
    deployment models that are used today, those being community, private,
    public, and hybrid.

                        community of consumers. Examples include universities
                        cooperating in certain research fields, or police
                        departments within a country or state sharing computing
                        resources. Access to a community cloud environment is
                        typically restricted to the members of said community.

    IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    IaaS typically provides access to network, storage and compute resources on
    a pay as you go basis. Users of this service can access a high level of
    flexibility and management control over IT resources. Users still manage
    their own applications, data, runtime and middleware on-premise. But the
    virtualisation, servers, storage and networking side of things is left to
    vendors off site.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    PaaS - Platform as a Service
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Platform as a service is mainly used by developers. It removes the need to
    manage any underlying infrastructure which is typically the hardware and
    operating system. This allows the user to focus on the development and
    management of their applications without the additional concerns of
    patching and managing their own Operating Systems, runtimes, servers, etc.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    SaaS - Software as a Service
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    SaaS can typically be demonstrated by website applications. These
    applications and everything needed to run them is hosted and managed
    externally. This provides a complete product that is run and managed by a
    service provider. An example of a SaaS product would be the google suite
    (gmail, docs, slides, sheets, etc.)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    With SaaS you don’t have to worry about how the service is going to be kept
    up to date or maintained as it is all managed off site. You also hold no
    responsibility when it comes to making sure that these applications aren’t
    vulnerable to outside attacks - of course that doesn’t mean you can just go
    giving out your passwords to strangers on the internet.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Cloud computing is becoming such a popular way of running business these
    days because it eliminates the need to engage with the capital expenses up
    front, such as purchasing hardware, set-up and running costs of on-premise
    servers and wages of in-house IT professionals.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This technology has revolutionised the traditional way that individuals and
    businesses think about data storage, IT resources and the workplace model.
    Although the concept of having data on remote computers is not new and has
    been around since the 1960s, the flexibility of services has increased so
    much due to cloud technologies. The cloud facilitates many positive impacts
    from unlimited scalability, flexibility, mobility, reliability, remote
    collaboration, communication and reduced overhead.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a result of the many benefits of cloud computing, organisations are
    adopting a cloud-first approach to replacing and implementing systems. As a
    consequence of this new transition, the IT job market is evolving and the
    dynamics of the work force in terms of required skills and job positions is
    continuing to adapt. Jobs with low experience and skill requirements have
    been affected significantly as a result of the adoption of cloud services.
    For example, administration, data entry, and secretarial jobs in the market
    have dramatically decreased in the last decade. Businesses no longer have
    as much of a need to employ low skilled individuals when they’re able to
    outsource tasks to autonomous cloud-based services. In terms of changes for
    IT, it’s becoming apparent that the need for companies to have on-premise
    system administrators is decreasing and these IT Professionals are being
    sourced into bigger corporations in order to accommodate for a majority of
    companies making their move to cloud-based services.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Current job positions such as software engineer, software architect, and
    DevOps Engineer are becoming more and more popular as the need for these
    skills is growing with the adoption of the cloud.

    In the foreseeable future, the increasing demand for highly skilled
    employees will affect other areas of life. Universities will have to adapt
    the way they are teaching IT Courses as the IT field is continuing to grow.
    It’s entirely possible that 10 years from now a Bachelor of IT will lose
    it’s meaning as it won’t indicate any particular skill.

    Autonomous Vehicles
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    Autonomous vehicles (or driverless) cars, are vehicles that use sensors,
    camera, radars and artificial intelligence to function without human
    operation. Autonomous vehicles are created to respond to conditions that a
    human would be able to manage, but their capabilities are even greater as
    the sensors are always on and the ability to avoid collision from blind
    spots is far greater. There are many companies experimenting with
    driverless vehicles of their own such as BMW, Ford, Audi, Volvo and the
    ever so popular Tesla.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), there are 6
    different levels of driving automation as shown here.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">

    Self-Driving vehicles are being engineered today to solve all kinds of
    problems caused by human error such as traffic delays and collisions. A
    driverless vehicle is able to sense and avoid danger much more consistently
    than an average human, as a result of this, collisions, injury and even
    death can be prevented in many cases due to artificial intelligence used in
    automated vehicles.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This technology is still working its way into our everyday lives. Most
    companies are still developing and trialling their own version of a
    self-driving car, however, not all have been successful. Those companies
    which have taken major strides include Waymo, the ‘sister’ company of
    Google. Waymo’s vehicle managed to accomplish 20 million miles driven only
    with automated technologies. Compare this to another successful example,
    General Motors Company, managed to complete almost half a million miles.
    While not quite as many as 20 million this is still a huge feat.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Tesla also has their own autonomous vehicle, however this technology is
    only a level 2 vehicle, meaning that the passenger can take control at any
    given moment. However, even with these advancements, the world has not been
    able to implement these vehicles into everyday life. Back in 2015, The
    Guardian predicted that by 2020, everyone will be a permanent back seat
    driver (Piper 2020). Elon Musk forecasted that by 2018, there will be
    self-driving cars but when that failed, he said 2020. Now in 2021, those
    cars are still yet to arrive. Despite the massive efforts put forward by
    car manufacturers, fully automated vehicles still aren’t filling our
    streets today as they are only available in trial programs.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Ford expected to have their first level 4 vehicle hit the streets in 2021.
    However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the company was forced to rethink its
    marketing strategy.

    The Victorian Transport Policy Institute believes that level 5, fully
    autonomous vehicles will be commercially available by the year 2030.
    Initially, these cars will be very expensive and would have limited
    performance. According to the institute’s research, by the year 2045, 40%
    of transportation will be autonomous. For most companies, self-driving cars
    are the way of the future, but there is no way for them to know how far
    into the future this will be for certain.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    While these ideas for driverless cars are fascinating and innovative. They
    have proven to be a lot more difficult than any of these companies could
    have predicted. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, believes that the
    accomplishment of self-driving cars is still a long way off. John Krafcik,
    CEO of Waymo, believes that driverless cars will never be able to function
    in all conditions. Despite all ambitions to make driverless cars a part of
    our lives, many companies are coming to the realisation that these cars are
    very difficult to produce.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Driverless cars will need extremely intricate systems that utilise a
    variety of technologies. To dive in deeper to this, there are two key
    sensors needed for a car to successfully identify its environment, a vision
    sensor, and a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Sensor. A LiDAR
    determines ranges by targeting an object with a laser, and measuring the
    time it takes for the light to come back. In short, these sensors are used
    to prevent collisions.

    Other technologies utilised by self-driving vehicles includes Advanced
    Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), which covers cruise control, collision
    warnings, traction control, etc. Another main component in the development
    of self-driving vehicles is AI and deep learning with neural networks (See
    Machine Learning section), these technologies are used to imitate the human
    brain in some form. It is said that AI is the lead for launching Level 5
    autonomous vehicles, which require zero human interaction.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Unless safety and security are ensured, people aren’t going to feel too
    comfortable owning and using a self-driving car, which is why the
    Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework (developed by Intel) is an
    important component in the making of such vehicles. Another system
    incorporated by many companies is the adaptive cruise control system. This
    system ensures that cars maintain a safe distance between other vehicles
    and will adjust the driving speed as necessary.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are many more applications of technology to be used with these
    vehicles. More recently would be the inclusion of 5G capabilities. This is
    said to enhance the connectivity to these cars, using a high-speed
    connection vehicles will more easily be able to communicate with their
    surroundings. This communication process is labelled as V2X or Vehicle to
    Everything. V2X includes vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle
    communication

    Implementing autonomous vehicles into our daily lives will have an immense
    impact on my family and I. Positive impacts include safe ways to travel,
    lower fuel costs, better parking and more. Travelling of course will be
    much easier as I would not have to worry as much as if I were the driver.
    I’ll also have a lot of time on my hands, allowing me to relax or complete
    tasks while the car is driving me to a location. It will also help protect
    members of our communities and other drivers due to the resulting reduction
    of reckless drivers occupying our roads.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Overall, Introducing autonomous cars will be the start of a new way of
    transportation that will be both safe, efficient and somewhat greener. I
    believe that the introduction of autonomous cars in the near future will
    bring about a positive change in the world and how we live our lives.

    It’s extremely common for kids these days to know how to use voice
    controlled home assistants such as Alexa and Siri. Our next generation is
    currently getting so much exposure to Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
    other technologies from such an early age. We are moving to a more
    knowledgeable generation which are comfortable with, and rely on this kind
    of technology on a daily basis.

    The reason this has been brought up is because in the future there’s a very
    high likelihood that robots will be in our offices, homes, and in fields.
    We humans are going to be interacting with more and more robots and

    The reason these technologies have been brought up in the first place is
    that they all have something in common. They’re all controlled by
    computers.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In today’s day and age, one of the most common technologies that are being
    used by engineers are Arduinos as they are a cheaper option than Raspberry
    Pi’s. But a lot of engineers prefer the Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi and others
    because they are ARM based computers capable of running multiple programs
    and multiple pieces of equipment simultaneously. Arduinos on the other hand
    are simply a programmable board with a microprocessor capable of running a
    single program.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Both of these options are a low-cost, low-power computer, initially created
    with the purpose of teaching younger people computer science skills.
    However, upon release of this technology tinkerer’s everywhere wanted to
    get their hands on them to create their own innovative projects without
    breaking the bank. The easiest way to think of a Raspberry Pi is to think
    of your smartphone, just without the screen, sensors, microphone, speakers,
    battery, camera, etc.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Raspberry Pi’s have many other practical uses as well. Such as hacking or
    penetration testing. Many black-hat hackers prefer this technology due to
    its flexibility, capabilities and compact size, making it easy to hide.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To explore the many capabilities Raspberry Pi’s have to offer, provided
    below are some explanations of the key components used to create innovative
    gadgets.

    General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One of the most powerful features of Raspberry Pi’s today is the strip of
    GPIO pins located at the top of the board. This GPIO strip is used for
    connecting the Pi to the outside world. For example, these pins allow you
    to do a whole variety of things such as turning on/off LEDs to running
    traffic lights and controlling motors.

    The middle 2 layers (Labelled B and C) are used for creating circuits with
    lights, motors, resistors, etc. On the outside layers (Labelled A and D) we

    Resistors
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Resistors are a crucial part of all electronics. They are used for many
    reasons such as to reduce current and divide voltages in a parallel
    circuit. For example, a 5mm blue LED has values of 3.4V and 30mA. Since
    both of these values are greater than the GPIO pins max supply (3.3v and
    16mA), connecting it directly to the strip will try to pull more than
    what’s available - damaging the GPIO strip over time. Using Ohm’s Law to
    solve this problem: V(volts) = I(Amps) x R(Resistance)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    3.4V / (.03A - .016A) = 242.86 We will need at least a 250(ohm) resistor.

    Increasing Resistance
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Resistors placed in a series will add to the total resistance of the
    circuit. In the image below, there are 3 220resistors placed in series,
    which increases the total resistance of the circuit to 660 (R 1+ R2+ ...RN=
    RTotal)

    Decreasing Resistance
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    By placing resistance in parallel you’re able to create smaller amounts of
    resistance across the board. This can be demonstrated by the equation

    1/RTotal= 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... 1/RN

    As you can see here there are three resistances all of 200 or greater.
    Using the equation above we are able to produce a total resistance of
    85.67. In reality, the resistance hasn't decreased, it’s just that the
    resistors have been made less efficient as a result of increased spread of
    electricity supply in the circuit.

                        This is another type of resistor that is responsive to
                        light. When light shines on the resistor, the material
                        absorbs the light and increases the conductivity of the
                        material - starting the equipment. In the absence of

    Project Idea
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
    For our group project, TESS decided to go with the PARKD Motorcycle parking
    application. Although the project was initially conceived by Emmet, all
    members of the group decided to pursue the same idea and equally
    contributed towards the project. On the 30th of June, we came together on
    MS Teams. We plan to utilize Sam for the back end, Taylor and Emmet for the
    front end, and Saajid for research and formatting.

    Overview
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    ParkD is a free motorcycle parking app for Sydney. It is an application for
    people who ride motorcycles daily, whether for work, leisure, or just
    getting from one place to another. The concept of the app is to create a
    platform which acts like an Airbnb for bike parking. ParkD is community-
    rated, which means that people in the community can input a location on the
    app, for motorbike parking which they know is safe and secure. The app
    locates the closest community rated parking near a chosen location. ParkD
    will provide timely motorcycle parking solutions to address the issue of
    reliable parking in Sydney.
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Motivation
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    There is a major problem in a lot of Australian cities right now when it
    comes to motorbike parking, with greater Sydney having 1145 thefts in the
last twelve months, as shown by    <a href="https://carsafe.com.au/motorcycle-map">NMVTRC</a>. As a result of
    this, we wanted to create an application that motorcyclists could easily
    use to find, rent, and occupy parking spaces for two-wheeled vehicles. The
    idea behind this application is to fill a huge gap in the market by
    providing riders with peace of mind, knowing that they can find, locate,
    and reserve safer parking using an app where information is provided by
    other motorcyclists in the area. It is especially concerning that more than
    half of the victims of motorbike theft never see their bikes again.

    Description
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    The beauty of the app is that users can register as parking landlords and
    rent their secure parking spots to other two wheeled users who require
    temporary parking solutions. The concept is a community-rated platform
    which acts like an Airbnb for two wheeled commuters. The app locates the
    closest community rated parking near a chosen location using geolocation.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To be able to provide our bikers with parking information we are going to
    rely on input from other users. For example, if someone were to park their
    motorbike in an available bay and noticed that there were multiple other
    spots available, they could put the location on a map for other bikers to
    see. Once another biker arrives at the location with the available parking,
    they can remove that parking spot from the map. Even if this second biker
    did not occupy the park themselves, they would still be able to remove it
    from the map.

    When developing ideas for this application, our group ran into its fair

    to input an estimated time that they would leave by. When the time the user
    entered was approaching (say 15 minutes prior), the application would send
    a notification to their phone, reminding them that time is almost up AND
    giving them the option to extend their time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    For all these functions to operate together in a cohesive way, much thought
    had to be given towards the backend.

<h4 dir="ltr">
    Backend Information
</h4>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Shared Database
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    User_cred – All user credentials are stored.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Landlord:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Parking_lot_registration – Stores the unique UserID. The QR code is
            same as userID
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Landlord_details – Keeps a record of the landlord contact, name
            etc.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Tenant:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Vehicle_info – Stores tenant vehicle model, number etc.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Qr_table – saves the qr codes and time it was generated
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            App_essentials - Stores time/date, landlord ID, Tenant ID and
            vehicle number temporarily.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Archive:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Deactivated account information, hidden advertisements are saved in the
    archive folder.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    QR Code
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    For every ‘landlord’, we will generate a QR code with an alphanumeric
    combination and store it in the qr_table DB. The QR code format is
    Date/time + Username + DOB.
</p>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Router/Cellular
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    If the user inputs something that needs to be routed to the IIS or the SQL
    server. The packets need to be routed to a public/private DNS first and
    resolve the name to IP address, then the request will be routed to the IP
    address (IIS, SQL server).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To use a public DNS server(eg. 8.8.8.8) we will need a static public IP
    address and port forwarding on our router on the web server end. Otherwise,
    we can also use DynDNS or No-IP. This basically keeps updating the IP
    address of a server in the public DNS, so even if the IP is dynamic, it can
    still be resolved from a Domain name.
</p>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Web Server/IIS
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    The website will be hosted by windows server 2016 or 2012 r2. It can also
    be hosted by Windows 10 if the computer has IIS service installed in it.
    For cloud hosting Wix, Azure, AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud can be used.
</p>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    SSL/TLS
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    For the prototype we may not use an SSL certificate, however in real life
    it is crucial to have an SSL. http:// does not encrypt any communication
    between the user and server. So, every communication is plain text and
    vulnerable.
</p>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    DNS (Private/Public)
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    To put it simply, DNS is a translator, it translates a domain name into an
    IP address. It can be private or public. Private DNS servers are mostly
    used for intranets. It can also be used for WAN. We will try both DNS and
    No-IP. No-IP is a dynamic DNS, which keeps a record of updated IP
    addresses. So, the domain name resolves to the updated IP address.
</p>
<br/>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    SQL Server (RDBMS)
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    A server that contains the database of QR codes, vehicle information and
    App essentials. Please note that the user_cred (credentials) is in the DMZ
    zone. So, no other table has relations with them. We have put the user_cred
    into the DMZ zone for security concerns, such as: SQL injection.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We will have Landlord DB and Tenant DB on different SQL servers. So, even
    if one physical machine is down the other mode can still work.
</p>

    Outcome
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    The potential outcome that we are hoping for with this project idea is to
    have a fully functioning app that allows a user to mark a parking space as
    safe, and for other riders to be able to occupy these locations. We will
    know that the app is fully functional when a motorcyclist is able to pull
    out their phone and mark their current or previous location as a secure
    parking spot. The app will also need to provide functionality for people
    with reserved parking bays to rent those out, and for riders to come to an
    agreement over our platform. If we can make motorcycle riders in
    Australia’s cities feel safer taking their bikes out wherever they go,
    knowing that they can locate a safe and secure parking spot for their bike,
    then we would be making the world a better place for many people.
